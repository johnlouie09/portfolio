He taught programming to us so right and fluently. Even that has no idea of programming can learn from him. I promise he\'s better than watching Youtube. He\'s also better at motivating students that are so down in programming. Also optimistic and will everyday make you special. Because of Sir Arvic, I am now good at programming, coding, communicating, and collaborating with people. Lastly, I am thankful that I\'m one of his students. Sir Arvic is best of best! ðŸ˜Ž'
